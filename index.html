        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p> My name is David Hilton, I am a Senior Mathematics major and 
            Computer Science minor. I am taking DIG245 to learn Front-End development. 
            I have extensive experience programming (both in school and personal use), but 
            I have not had much exposure to Web development. In this course I hope to learn 
            the tool necessary to create interactive web pages that meet user needs.

        <h3>A bit about Web Servers...</h3>
        <p>
            In short, a web server is a software service that can accept requests and
            return responses. This is how we access information online, we make resquests
            and the software behind the application returns information based on that
            request. An important part of organizing web servers is the Domain System (DNS)
            which allows user to find what they are looking for with URLs. Registering your
            applications Domnain Name and IP address (server location) alows users to easily
            find your website. While any Domain name is possible, most domains have already 
            been purchased, and there is a significant market for re-selling these domain 
            names. This is a breif overview of Web Servers and the DNS.

            <li><a href="https://teropa.info/loop/#/systemdefinition">
                How Generative Music Works</a>: This projects gives a look into 
                the ways in which music can be created systematically. This occurs
                through systems which are defined as networks with organized shcemes
                or methods.

            <li><a href="https://ilovechrisbaker.com/projects/troll-the-nsa/">Troll the NSA</a>:
                This project is pretty self explanatory, it trolls the NSA. The devs have encouraged
                users to send mass emails containing a script that will be flagged as suspicious by
                the NSA.
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://www.cowclicker.com/">Cow Clicker</a>: This project is a game that
                allows users to click a cow over periods of time. The more a user clicks the cow, 
                the more acheivements and customization they unlock.
